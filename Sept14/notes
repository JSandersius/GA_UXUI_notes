PROTOTYPING --> sketchup and invision 

Prototyping -- usability testing 

Prototyping--> early model --> working model --> beta testing 

goal is testing 

faster, easier to do --> ma medium fidelity in prototyping 
code can be statically ritten and not robust

no data stored -->  

testing needs high fidelity  model

MOBILE FIRST DEVELOPMENT 
It is one of the best strategies to create either a 
responsive or adaptive design. The mobile-first 
approach is a tenet of progressive enhancement. 
It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, 
should be done first. Once the mobile design questions 
are answered, designing for other devices will be easier.

this is a great time to A/B test--> 

edgecase --> flows for majority , but sometimes you  need to account for a small minority. 
need to research the smallest of details to make sure they account for people with other needs 
identify edgecased early on 

test prototype --> 

lofi<------------>hifi 
concept             interactions 
assumptions         animations 
user flows          nomenclature 
what it is          how it works
what it does        how it feels
where it goes       how it looks 


____________
Four points to test against
-utility
-usability 
-desirability           _______low fidelity may lack in these two 
-emotional connection  

_______
know what your prototype is NOT testing. 

a lot if feedback will be gathered that is not needed 
give them specific tasks to go through 

create the simplet prototype possible 

--Use real words and not lorem ipsum 
--test prototype bedore putting in froont of a user

USABILITY TESTING --> -->    

_______
Main Methods --> 
moderated - in person 
moderated - remote
unmoderated, remote 
guerilla testing (hallway)


HC department at apple 
_______
Approaches to usability testing ... GO BE A USABILITY TEST subject --> google, twitter, look up co's 
warm it up, make sure the tester is uncomfortable 

--> for now, guerilla 

set up lab, book two rooms, smaller room is testing room, everything is recorded and 
live streamed to larger room where group of statkeholders are watching 

_______
usability testing is first part of second diamond, but it can be done later
__need to know what you're doing before user testing, what you need to know 

___________
Learnability --> you do not want a learning curve 

Efficiency --> it's all about convenience, serve the user

Memorability --> how long does it take for the user to learn your product all the way through 

ERror management --> pre-empt errors, guide user 

Satifaction --> how satisfied are the users? 




_______
LEARNABILITY 

make it look good upon fist inspection 

put only the core features up front at the outset 

make core features super easy to use 

allow users to discover more (or advanced) features as they become more invested 

offer features when/where it's relevant 

_______
guidelines on innovating 

what are users knowledge levels coming into the sight? 

what are users expectations for a site like this? 

how important/ necessary is this sight to the users? 

how fuequently will they use the sight? the more thay use it, the more you can innovate 

how much did they pay?  

what are the other options? 


__________________________
EFFICIENTY  -> reduce page loads 

UX is about communiction , not just making thing pretty 

offer shortcuts to user 

anticipate user needs  --> "buy it again?" 

--> even if it takes longer..
    does it feel easier to use? 
    does it delight users? 
    does it make stronger connections with users? (story)
how critical is speed? 

how are users gaining at the cost of speed?

MEMORABILITY -> how easy is it o rememebr how to use your site? 
        consider usability of reports, ant document passed on 

    Automation --> predict what next froo user, utilize a smooth flow through input 

    remove all elements that are not essential (including animations) 

    diversify content (text, images, videos, links , etc. )

    organize and layout page for the scan-ability and comprehension 

    chunk options/ content

    be consistent --> you will drive people up a wall if you lack consistency 
__________
guidlines on memorability, best pracitices 
    -how high is thr coct to learn? (see learnability innovation guidelines)
    -how easy wsa it to learn before compared to now?  


_______no innovating for error management or Satifaction
ERROR MANAHEMENT 

    are errors infrequent and handled elegantly? 

        -anticipate errors and prevent them 
        -be clear about where the error is 
        -be infomative so the user can course rcorrect 
        -be friendly and offer alternative paths and support 
         
__________
SATISFACTION 

appealing , layout and organization 
flawless
distinguish from others in same category --> gigher level UX design 
suprise and delight 

-----> stay testing -->  
 

Usability test

Define 
Prepare --> be involved with user intrviewees recruitent process
conduct 
analyze 


__________-
Learnability is it easy to learn effortless, efficiency: does it complete the task quickly , memorable: , error mangement , satisfaction





_______
-_______
what is usability and task? 

goal-what users want 

task - user goals broken down to be specific, relaistic 

scenario - made up situation 

_________-

Guidlines for writing tasks 
1. make it only as specific as needed to test, keep it realistic 

2. make it actionable

3. dont give specific steps 
___________
Guidelines for writing scenerios and tasks   
1. Make it only as specific as neded to test, keep it realistic 

2. Make it actionable--> has a clear flow and leads to a definintive 

3. Be specific 
__________________________

1. Make it realistic  --> frame questions with a scenario --> 

2. Make the task actionable  --> frame questions with a scenario --> 

3. Avoid clues and dscribing steps
