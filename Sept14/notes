PROTOTYPING --> sketchup and invision 

Prototyping -- usability testing 

Prototyping--> early model --> working model --> beta testing 

goal is testing 

faster, easier to do --> ma medium fidelity in prototyping 
code can be statically ritten and not robust

no data stored -->  

testing needs high fidelity  model

MOBILE FIRST DEVELOPMENT 
It is one of the best strategies to create either a 
responsive or adaptive design. The mobile-first 
approach is a tenet of progressive enhancement. 
It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, 
should be done first. Once the mobile design questions 
are answered, designing for other devices will be easier.

this is a great time to A/B test--> 

edgecase --> flows for majority , but sometimes you  need to account for a small minority. 
need to research the smallest of details to make sure they account for people with other needs 
identify edgecased early on

what it does        how it feels
where it goes       how it looks 


____________
Four points to test against
-utility
-usability 
-desirability           _______low fidelity may lack in these two 
-emotional connection
