Broad definition of design UX
Business case for UX design 
double diamond design process 
different roles in UX
What key traits make for a good UX designer / student 

design i how we communicate what an object translates —> the process to solve a problem 
MULE DESIGN 

equating UI design too product design —> backpacks, I made a backpack 
user needs are paramount 


--> intersection of human empathy and sytematic problem solving 
what will the users experience be like? 

visual design 
fuctionlaity 
data visualization 
info arch 
cognitive psyc 
ect. 

UX is subjective --> 

users --> designers --> business  

hero element --> emotionally appealing 

database vs whitespace  
database does not prioritize beauty

UX is the art and science of generating positive emotions throuhg interaction with technology 

business strategy 
save money, time and [people] power

business goals vs user goals   
UX is acheiving balance between the two 

UX is skillset and job-set 

--> sight-mapping  --> audits application 
"user flow" 

storyboarding --> 
mazlos heirarchy of needs --> 

wireframe --> in grey --> low fidelity -->


--> 
high competition in application-land --> need to appeal to users off the bat

dont assume anything 
dont assume you know thier problems
dont assume they will behave the way you want them to 
dont assume you've thought of anything 


Designer ignores the user 

users irritated ect. 


undertsnd the proble before solution 

advocates for the user ans thier needs

saves time and money, both for business and costomer

avoids featuritis by balancing utility with simplicity 


_______________________
UX PROCESS 
who what abd why and for whom

design the right thing---> design it right 

double diamond 


research --> synth --> (redefine problem statement) ideate --> deliver 

________________
Step 1: research 
identify users and statkeholders --> speak and observe 
empathize while gatheing indsight same

Desk research 
mind mapping 
competitive analysis
caontent audits 
data gathering 
user interviews
stakeholder interviews 
contexual inquiry 
uasbility testing 
ethnographic studies 


ecidence based development --> 

______
step 2 synthesize --> 

reearch review
affinity mapping (cluster themes)
user personas and/or archetypes
--> gather problem statments
THEMES 
price
parking 
group travel 
convenient storage 

________________
step 2 re-define 
"redefine hypthesized problem for opportunity 
provide clarity based synthesized findings 

 
INSIGHT --what did we find? 
PERSONA --who is the intedned audience? build arhcetype
PROBLEM  --what problem 
GOAL  --how to solve ->



""insight""
"persona" "user problem" 
how might we "opportunity/ goal" 





________________
STEP 4 Ideation 

an iterative process : design  prototype, test , iterate (repeat)

the goal: develop the ide from low-fidelity to high fidelity 




STEP 5 Deliver --> --> 
synthesize research analu=yze tasks, make key decisions
the goal: identify and valiate the porblem and solution 

interfave is going from actively weilding tool to converational with AI
