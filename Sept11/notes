Research --> synthesize

be the user advocate, some firms split up business objectives and user objectives

main mission as UX designer is user research, 
    need to incorporate user into design process
        find problems

end user - TARGET AUDIENCE customer 

user is differeciated from client --> conflict of interest  


in interview --> "what is user research?"  --> "THE PRACTICE OF.." 


user researach is the practice of : 

1- identifying your end user  --> throw out assumptions 

2- posing good questions --> 

3- listening intently and openly 

4- deeply understanding exisisting problems --> 
    do you know enough? keep researching until you cant go any further 
    deeply is subjective, find a common pattern it could be an indication that you've interviewed enough people 

5- unvcovering opportunities --> 
    explore opportunities 
    develop huge data set, divy it down 
    glean insights from data
    stay concious of clients interests 

    --> how much time do you have? 
    --> budget and plan 


_______________________
need to be representative of users needs, 
    believe in UX, and advocate for it
        --> you are never a user, it is a right you give away 
        --> 
    1 unconcious bias comes up, so you must become informed of other peoples needs

    2 different people want differnet things, you can onlr represent one type 
    
    3 your goal is to solve the collective users problem, not one user's, 
      so that your design solution will resonate with a large audience 



_______________________
4 reasons why 
    --> look this up 

1 
creates design relevant to users
    .without reserearch we cant understantd them 
    .without being able to understand them we cannot empathize to connect with them 
    .if what you design doesnt connect them, they will not use it 
    .understanding your user is the crux of User-Centered-Design 

2 
good design is about poblem solving, not just making things look goos
 to solv e aproblem , you must first have to understand it , deeply 
 you cant solve eveything, to know which problem smatter , you need to understand how many problems you have and what they are 
_______________________
_______________________dont focus on design until data is collected 


3 
alligns team memabers understanding of the problem set
removes incorrect assumptiosns people may have going into the project 
gives a clear direction for the project to move forward together 


4 sves time and money 

reseach up front can help you avoid designing or building things that dont matter
continual research can validate your ideas and save you time and money 
makes roi visible --> return on investment

WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DISCOVER ?
3 things --> 

1 internal factors (people) 
- demsographics, culture, habits, dynamics
- education: social, acedemic 
- moods: enviromental, personal 


2 GOALS AND TASKS
- what is the user tring to accomplish 
- what is the users mitivation? 
- what tasks must the user complete to accomplish thier GOALS
- where are the pain points or chalenges in the curesnt ways they go about these tasks? 

3 EXTERNAL FACTORS ("CONTEXT")
- enviroments 
- distractions 
- technologies: analog, digital, communications 

ASK
talk to potential users, current user( if available, )
competitive users (unless asked not to )

LOOK 
observe people in thier real lives/ watch people use equivalent or comparable things


LISTEN 
social media listening/ blogs/, customer reviews, app store review, forums, etc. 

TRY
embody or walk in another persons shoes 

getting all of these is rare>>

generative vs evaluating 

behavioral vs attitudinal 

behavioral --> what peoples do 
attitudinal  --> what peole day 

quantitative vs qualitative 

quantitative
how many and how much 


different user research methods

-user interiews--> 
-crad sorting --> informatio narchetecture --> how peole organize info 
-surveys
-eye tracking 
-AB testing
-contextual inquiry 
-diary studies 
-focus groups 


-_______________________
one one conversations between researcher and participant
produces qualitative data
tends to be more qualitative than quantitative 

very personal --> creates empathy 
produces rish qualitative info 
enables follow up questions 




-----> good questions vs good questions? 

ask open ended questions --> no yes or not q's

ask about behaviour, not intenction 

avoid leading questions 

avoid compund questions

avoid pointing out specific issue , allow
