Research --> synthesize

be the user advocate, some firms split up business objectives and user objectives

main mission as UX designer is user research, 
    need to incorporate user into design process
        find problems

end user - TARGET AUDIENCE customer 

user is differeciated from client --> conflict of interest  


in interview --> "what is user research?"  --> "THE PRACTICE OF.." 


user researach is the practice of : 

1- identifying your end user  --> throw out assumptions 

2- posing good questions --> 

3- listening intently and openly 

4- deeply understanding exisisting problems --> 
    do you know enough? keep researching until you cant go any further 
    deeply is subjective, find a common pattern it could be an indication that you've interviewed enough people 

5- unvcovering opportunities --> 
    explore opportunities 
    develop huge data set, divy it down 
    glean insights from data
    stay concious of clients interests 

    --> how much time do you have? 
    --> budget and plan 


_______________________
need to be representative of users needs, 
    believe in UX, and advocate for it
        --> you are never a user, it is a right you give away 
        --> 
    1 unconcious bias comes up, so you must become informed of other peoples needs

    2 different people want differnet things, you can onlr represent one type 
    
    3 your goal is to solve the collective users problem, not one user's, 
      so that your design solution will resonate with a large audience

4 reasons why 
    --> look this up 

1 creates design relevant to users
    .without reserearch we cant understantd them 
    .without being able to understand them we cannot empathize to connect with them 
    .if what you design doesnt connect them, they will not use it 
    .understanding your user is the crux of User-Centered-Design
